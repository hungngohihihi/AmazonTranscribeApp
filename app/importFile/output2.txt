English class English class how do we make it remarkable how do we create an incredible English class I'm asking myself that question every day now because we are starting a San Francisco effortless language Club an English conversation Club but not only English will also teach Japanese hopefully will soon add Spanish and maybe other languages too but I don't want a normal English class most English classes are boring and ineffective ours will be effective I already know that because I'll be using the same effortless English method I use in my MP3 English lessons but I think that a great teaching method is only part of being remarkable a truly great class needs more to be great and English class needs to support students emotions it needs to inspire them motivate them energize them and entertain them a great English class was also be a true Community Place of friendship where meaningful connections are made between Learners and between teachers and Learners a great English class must be a beautiful place the room must be decorated beautifully in a way that instantly and automatically makes Learners feel both relaxed and alert of course all of this will evolve we're starting small with a tiny office space and a couple of students but our goal is big and it's absolutely not modest our goal is to have the greatest English class in the world yes a great side benefit of the San Francisco effortless English classes is that will have more MP3 English lessons I will record myself teaching every class and every few months will sell the new collection of lessons
